==  SpringBoot 2 sample application that can be deployed on OpenShift

Zero configuration; In case you want to customize generated resources you can do it via:

    Plugin XML configuration
    external resource fragments
    Dockerfiles
    
    
http://localhost:8080/add/1/1
http://localhost:8080/list

 mvn oc:deploy
 
 mvn oc:undeploy
 
 
 Eclipse JKube is a set of tools which Java developers can use to build and deploy their applications on Kubernetes/OpenShift. We have two separate plugins for Kubernetes and OpenShift which are focused towards java development on these platforms:
  
The openshift-maven-plugin is your best friend to bring your Java applications on to OpenShift. It provides a tight integration into Maven and benefits from the build configuration already provided. 

This plugin focus on building Docker images and creating Kubernetes resource descriptors. It ships with a flexible configuration and supports multiple models for creating resources such as a Zero-Config setup which allows for a quick ramp-up with some opinionated defaults.

   <plugin>
            <groupId>org.eclipse.jkube</groupId>
            <artifactId>openshift-maven-plugin</artifactId>
            <version>1.0.0-alpha-1</version>
  
      <plugin>
                <groupId>org.eclipse.jkube</groupId>

                 <version>1.0.0-alpha-1</version>
            </plugin>

 In order to make docker image of your project, you just need to run command:



    mvn k8s:build
    
    
In order to generate Kubernetes/Openshift artifacts, just run the resource goal:

    mvn k8s:resource
    
If you check your target directory you can see the generated artifacts in target/classes/META-INF/jkube/ directory
    
TO deploying your application is just about applying those generates resources onto the cluster. You just need to do:

    mvn k8s:apply
